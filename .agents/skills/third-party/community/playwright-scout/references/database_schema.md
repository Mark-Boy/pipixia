# Local Database Schema

The default data directory is `~/.linkedin-outreach`. Override it with `LINKEDIN_OUTREACH_DATA_DIR` or `--data-dir`.

## Signal Source Types

- `post_intent`: the lead authored a post that matched an intent/keyword query. Usually target role `original_poster`.
- `activity_engagement`: the lead engaged with a watched person/company activity feed. Usually target role `comment_engager`.
- `comment_keyword`: the lead authored a comment matching tracked keywords. Usually target role `comment_author`.
- `post_comment`: the lead commented on one explicit watched post.

Intent labels:

- `buyer_intent`: post/comment appears to express demand for a person, tool, vendor, solution, or recommendation.
- `hiring_role`: post appears to be hiring for a role rather than buying a service.
- `provider_promo`: post/comment appears to be a provider promoting their own service.
- `discussion`: relevant discussion without a direct buying phrase.

## Lead Status Fields

`status` tracks review state:

- `spotted`: discovered but not reviewed.
- `queued`: approved for an outbound action.
- `rejected`: intentionally skipped.
- `contacted`: at least one outbound action has been attempted.

`connection_status` tracks the connection workflow:

- `not_sent`
- `queued`
- `sent`
- `pending`
- `connected`
- `failed`
- `skipped`

`messaging_status` tracks DMs:

- `not_started`
- `initial_sent`
- `responded`
- `failed`
- `skipped`

## db/signals.json

Reusable radar definitions:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
  "signals": [
    {
      "name": "competitor-ceo-cyriac-lefort-engagers",
      "type": "activity",
      "enabled": true,
      "source_label": "Engaged with Cyriac Lefort",
      "target_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyriaclefort/",
      "query": null,
      "keywords": [],
      "intent": null,
      "limit": 10,
      "max_posts": 3,
      "scrolls": 5,
      "expand_rounds": 3,
      "created_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "seo-buyer-intent-posts",
      "type": "post_intent",
      "enabled": true,
      "source_label": "SEO buyer intent post",
      "target_url": null,
      "query": "looking for SEO consultant",
      "keywords": [],
      "intent": "buyer_intent",
      "limit": 10,
      "max_posts": 5,
      "scrolls": 4,
      "expand_rounds": 4,
      "created_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Signal types:

- `activity`: run `scout-activity`.
- `comment_keyword`: run `scout-comment-keyword`.
- `post_intent`: run `scout-search` with optional intent filtering.

## db/templates.json

Editable templates. Connection requests send without notes by default; `connection_note`
is kept blank so notes are only sent when a final one-off custom message is passed with
`--message` for a single lead.

```json
{
  "connection_note": "",
  "initial_dm": "Hi {first_name}, thanks for connecting. I noticed {source_label} and thought it could be useful to compare notes."
}
```

Supported DM placeholders:

- `{first_name}`
- `{full_name}`
- `{headline}`
- `{source_label}`
- `{profile_url}`

## db/suppressions.json

Profiles in this file are never inserted or updated as leads. Use it for competitors,
accounts the operator explicitly does not want to contact, and other permanent
exclusions.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example-competitor/",
      "profile_handle": "example-competitor",
      "reason": "competitor",
      "added_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## db/safety_state.json

When LinkedIn shows a checkpoint, CAPTCHA, identity verification, restriction, or
unusual-activity prompt, the script records a local cooldown and refuses new
browser-heavy commands until the cooldown expires.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
  "cooldown_until": "2026-04-26T12:00:00Z",
  "last_stop": {
    "condition": "verify_your_identity",
    "detected_at": "2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
    "cooldown_hours": 24,
    "screenshot": "/Users/example/.linkedin-outreach/screenshots/stop_condition_123.png"
  }
}
```
